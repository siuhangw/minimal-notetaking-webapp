### **1. Introduction & Vision** üìù

In a world saturated with complex, feature-heavy applications, there's a growing need for simple, focused tools. "Quick Jot" is a minimalist notetaking web application designed for users who want to capture and organize their thoughts without the distraction of unnecessary features. Our vision is to provide the quickest and most straightforward way for users to jot down, find, and manage their notes.

### **2. Problem Statement** ü§î

Existing notetaking apps are often bloated with features that the average user doesn't need, leading to a cluttered interface and a steep learning curve. This complexity can hinder the primary function of a notetaking app: to quickly and easily capture information. Users need a tool that is fast, intuitive, and focuses solely on the essentials of notetaking.
