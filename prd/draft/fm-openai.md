# Product Requirements Document – Minimal Note-Taking Web App

## Overview

This PRD outlines the core capabilities of a simple web-based note-taking application from the end-user’s perspective. The product is a minimalist note-taking tool: a digital notepad that lets users capture and organize text notes quickly. Note-taking apps provide a convenient, efficient way to capture, organize, and retrieve information. For this MVP, the app will focus on basic plain-text notes with a clean interface and reliable storage.

## Goals and Objectives

* **Core functionality:** Enable users to quickly create and edit notes with minimal effort (this aligns with the MVP focus on basic text entry).
* **Intuitive experience:** Provide a clean, distraction-free UI so users can focus on writing. The interface should be simple and consistent to reduce clutter.
* **Data persistence:** Ensure notes are saved reliably as users edit them, so no data is lost (auto-save or quick save behavior).
* **Cross-device access:** Allow users to view and update their notes on any device. Notes will be synchronized via the cloud or user account so that the latest content is available wherever the user logs in.
* **Validate user needs:** Build only essential features first to gather user feedback. By focusing on the minimal viable product (MVP) features (basic text entry, saving, listing notes), the team can iterate based on what users truly need.

## User Stories

User stories are framed in the “As a \[persona], I \[want to], \[so that]” format. Core user stories for the note-taking app include:

* *As a user, I want to create a new note so that I can quickly record ideas or information.*
* *As a user, I want to edit the content of an existing note so that I can update or expand my thoughts.*
* *As a user, I want to delete a note so that I can remove outdated or irrelevant information.*
* *As a user, I want to view a list of all my notes so that I can navigate and select the one I need.*
* *As a user, I want my notes to be automatically saved so that I don’t lose my work.*
* *As a user, I want to log in and see the same notes on any device so that I can access my notes from anywhere.*

## Features

* **Plain-text editor:** A simple note editor that allows basic typing and line breaks only (no rich formatting). This meets the core MVP requirement of text entry.
* **Create/Edit/Delete notes:** Users can add new notes, modify existing ones, and delete notes they no longer need – the essential CRUD operations for note management.
* **Notes list (sidebar):** A sidebar or list view showing all saved notes (by title or first line). Users can select a note to view or edit it.
* **Automatic saving:** Notes are saved automatically as the user types or when they finish editing, ensuring changes are persisted immediately.
* **Persistent storage:** Notes are stored securely (e.g. in a cloud database or browser storage) so that they persist across sessions. This implies a simple user account or device-based storage under the hood.
* **Cross-device synchronization:** Notes are synchronized via the backend, allowing the same notes to appear on multiple devices. For example, if a user logs in on another device, they see all their existing notes.
* **Clean, minimalist UI:** The interface will be uncluttered and responsive. For example, a two-pane layout (sidebar + editor) will be used so that notes and controls are organized without distractions. Essential controls like “New Note” and “Delete” will be clearly labeled with simple icons.

## Non-Goals

This MVP will explicitly **not** include advanced or non-essential features:

* *No rich text formatting:* Features like bold/italic text, bullet lists, or tables will be omitted. Notes are plain text only.
* *No multimedia:* Users cannot insert images, audio, or video into notes.
* *No real-time collaboration:* There will be no multi-user editing or sharing of notes in this version. Each user’s notes are private.
* *No advanced organization:* The app will not support tags, nested folders, or categories beyond a flat note list (future updates may add labeling or folders).
* *No powerful search or analytics:* Only basic search (if any) will be available. Full-text search across notes or analysis of note content is out of scope.
* *No offline-only mode:* A full offline mode (beyond basic caching) is not provided in the MVP (internet will be required to sync notes).
* *No plugin or extension support:* Integrations (like web clipping or API) are not considered for the initial release.

## Assumptions and Constraints

* We assume users have **stable internet access** and use a modern browser or device (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.). The app will not initially support very old browsers or require proprietary plugins.
* **Technical constraints:** The app will be implemented as a lightweight web application (e.g. JavaScript/HTML/CSS with a simple backend). Heavy frameworks or libraries should be avoided to maintain performance.
* **Design constraint:** The UI must follow a minimalistic design. As one guideline notes, the layout and navigation should be consistent and uncluttered (for example, using clear labels and avoiding excess menus).
* **Resource assumptions:** With a small development team and tight timeline, we assume limited resources. Thus, only core features will be built initially.
* **Security assumptions:** Basic user authentication (email/password) may be used to secure notes. We assume a simple security model initially; advanced encryption or enterprise-level security is deferred.
* **Performance assumption:** The MVP targets a small to moderate user base. We assume a few hundred to a few thousand notes in total, so ultra-high scalability is not a priority in this phase.

## Initial UI Mockup Description

The UI will use a two-pane design for simplicity. Key elements include:

* **Sidebar (left):** This panel lists all note titles (or first lines) and includes a “New Note” button at the top. A small search/filter box can be added here in the future. The sidebar provides quick navigation among notes.
* **Header:** A minimal top bar displays the app name (e.g. “My Notes”). On the right it may show a user icon or settings menu.
* **Editor pane (right):** Occupies the main area. It shows the selected note’s title (editable) and a large text area for the note body. When no note is selected, the editor area shows placeholder text like “Select or create a note.”
* **Overall style:** The layout follows best practices for clarity. The fonts will be legible and controls (buttons/icons) will be intuitive. A light color scheme or whitespace is used to keep focus on the text. Key actions (save, delete, new) are clearly visible and placed consistently.

## Future Considerations

These are ideas for later versions beyond the MVP:

* **Rich formatting & media:** Support bold/italic, lists, headings, and the ability to attach images, audio, or other files to notes.
* **Alternative input methods:** Voice-to-text note entry or handwriting/drawing (if using a touchscreen) could be added.
* **Collaboration & sharing:** Real-time co-editing of notes, and the ability to share notes or notebooks with other users (with access controls).
* **Tags and organization:** Ability to tag notes or group them into folders/notebooks for better organization.
* **Advanced search:** Full-text search across all notes, including searching within note contents.
* **Offline access:** A robust offline mode or mobile app (PWA) so users can work without internet and sync when back online.
* **Security enhancements:** End-to-end encryption of notes, biometric login (e.g. fingerprint unlock), and other privacy features.
* **Mobile apps:** Native iOS/Android versions or improved mobile-friendly design.
* **Export/Integration:** Options to export notes (e.g. PDF/Markdown) or integrate with other services (calendar reminders, web clippers, etc.).

**Sources:** This PRD structure and content is based on standard product documentation practices and general note-taking app requirements. All listed features and design suggestions align with the minimal MVP approach (e.g. basic text entry focus and simple UI guidelines).
